        <p>Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle invented in 1883 where the objective is to move a stack of discs from the first rod to the third.</p>
        <p>There are only three rules:</p>
        <ul class='directions'>
          <li>Only one disk can be moved at a time.</li>
          <li>Every move involves taking the top disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack.</li>
          <li>No disk can be put on top of a smaller disk.</li>
        </ul>
